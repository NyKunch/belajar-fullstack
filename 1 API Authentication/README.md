# Part of my web develompent learning jurney
Today's learning is about API Authentication.
New knowledge that i know today is there are 4 types of API Authentication, they are:
- No Authentication at all
- Basic Authentication (Using "username: password" that have been entrcypted using base64)
- API Key Authorisation (Using API Key that is generated by the server)
- Token Based Authentication (Token is generated by giving permission access, ex. Oauth)

My mistake on today's coding practice:
- Reffering to "index.js" instead of "index.ejs" when using res.render() method.
- Forgetting to use CONST when declaring a new variable.
