# Learning Summary

This project main idea is to highlight the countries that have been visited. 

Using postgres to retrieve the database and map through the database to get country_code. 

Application Feature:
- Show every country that had been visited.
- Add new country using the input text section.


Update: 
- Fixing minor bug when user type the wrong country name by returning error to the form's placeholder.
- Using wildcard to match the user input with the database's country name on database querying.
